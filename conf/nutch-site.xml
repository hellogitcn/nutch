     <description>Regular expression naming plugin directory names to
      include.  Any plugin not matching this expression is excluded.
      In any case you need at least include the nutch-extensionpoints plugin. By
      default Nutch includes crawling just HTML and plain text via HTTP,
      and basic indexing and search plugins. In order to use HTTPS please enable 
      protocol-httpclient, but be aware of possible intermittent problems with the 
      underlying commons-httpclient library.
